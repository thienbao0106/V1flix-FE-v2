WEBVTT

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.110
It's spring.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.110
I've graduated from high school,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.150
and start my job today!

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.190
And can you believe it? I'll be working at-

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.550
A game company!

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.590
I'm Suzukaze Aoba.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.220
Nice to meet you.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.650
I'm Suzukaze Aoba.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.970
Nice to meet you.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.420
The day I become an adult has finally come!

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.590
All right!

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.530
Wait, can I really just walk in?

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.160
Hey, stop that!

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.870
Just kidding.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.580
This is a business, so children aren't allowed to enter.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.980
I-I'm sorry.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.540
No, that's not it!

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.790
I'm Suzukaze Aoba, and I'll be working at Eagle Jump.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.710
Nice to meet you!

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.850
Oh, you're a new employee?

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.550
I'm sorry, I just assumed...

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.090
No, I'm sorry, too.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.600
I'm Suzukaze Aoba.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.560
Have you heard that I'll be joining the company?

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.410
Suzukaze...

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.580
Yeah, I've heard!

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.320
We're on the same team.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.750
I'm Toyama Rin, the AD.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.700
Nice to meet you.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.200
There's a pro standing right in front of me!

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.060
U-Um, it must be tough being an AD.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.740
They're on TV all the time and have
so many different tasks to handle.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.100
They seem really busy.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.150
Oh, my AD isn't for "Assistant Director", it's for "Art Director".

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.430
So my job is to manage all of the visuals.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.150
I'm so sorry!

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.350
No, it's fine!

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.290

And get going with warm feelings

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.380
This is your desk.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.420
Oh, would you like something to drink?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.880
Sure, I'd like some orang-

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.630
No, wait, I'm a business woman starting today!

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.140
Coffee. Black.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.180
I'm glad she seems so nice.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.600
And now I'll get to work!

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.730
I'm exhau...

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.320
I can't take it...

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.080
A-A monster?

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.370
P-Panties?!

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.420
Pa-PaPaPa-Pa-PaPa-

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.900
A middle schooler?

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.020
Why is there a child here?

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.900
I'm not a child!

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.230
Oh, you're awake?

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.190
Rin, who is this?

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.700
This is Suzukaze Aoba-san. She's starting today.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.200
Would you like mine?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.780
Thanks.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.540
Huh. Which team is she-

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.910
There's no sugar in this!

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.750
Oh, sorry, I mixed them up.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.580
Let's trade!

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.130
You act really grown up.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.500
You drink it black?

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.960
I'm an adult, after all.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.760
I can handle this much.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.140
Obviously you can't!

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.310
So, how old are you?

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.390
Eighteen.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.230
Oh?

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.520
So you joined after graduating from high school.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.810
That's rare.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.190
But you don't even look old enough to be a high schooler.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.480
W-What about you?

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.650
How old are you?

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.150
How old do I look?

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.910
What should I do?

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.950
I can't just say something random.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.410
That's-

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.290
A Fairies Story poster!

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.210
Oh, you know it?

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.340
It's the first game I was involved with.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.000
I was addicted to it back in grade school!

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.800
That's how I found out about this company...

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.300
A-A-A-A...

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.050
Are you over thir-

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.060
I'm not that old!

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.310
I'm 25.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.600
I also joined after graduating from high school.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.480
Um, I'm sorry.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.940
You don't need to worry about it.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.440
By the way...

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.650
How old do I look?

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.900
23...?

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.650
We're the same age!

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.450
She's a good girl.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.030
B-But I'm so moved!

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.950
The people who made the game I loved so much as a child are right in front of me!

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.460
I especially loved the character design.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.960
In that case, Yagami Ko here created the character designs for Fairies Story.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.550
You're Yagami-sensei?!

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.090
Your attitude suddenly changed...

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.970
And Yagami is your boss now,

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.850
so I hope the two of you get along.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.650
I-I'll do my betht!

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.860
Oh, she messed it up.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.470
F-Forget about that!

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.240
I quickly introduced myself to the team and then got to work.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.120
Apparently I'm the only new employee this year.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.580
It makes me feel a bit dismayed.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.540
No, no! Stop being so negative, Aoba!

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.250
I've got to start by making friends with my neighbours!

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.000
Um-

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.140
I can't!

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.900
I guess that pose will work.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.570
What's with this company?!

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.700
Is the person who sits there not here today?

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.250
Good morning.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.500
Good morning!

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.760
U-Um!

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.970
I'm Suzukaze Aoba, and I started working here today.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.680
Takimoto Hifumi.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.930
Nice to meet you.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.310
Are you also part of the character team, Takimoto-san?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.560
I-I'm sorry...

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:26.900
What should I do...

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.650
I don't feel like I'll be able to make friends with any of them!

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.360
Eh?

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.200
Why's there a cat in the office?

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:42.950
You're so cute.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.460
Oh, there you are.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.580
So you came all the way over here to play?

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.090
You're the new employee, Suzukaze Aoba-kun, right?

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.220
I apologise for my little one.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.090
Oh, no.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.100
You're cute.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.860
I'm the director of the game this team is making, Haduki Shizuku.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.240
O-Oh! Nice to meet you!

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.110
That cat...

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.740
Her name is Mozuku.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.120
I bring her with me once in a while.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.410
If I leave her at home every day,

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.040
she gets bored and causes trouble, you see.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.250
Haduki-san.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.160
I've been looking for you.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.670
Oh, Umiko-kun.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.000
Do you need something?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.960
The meeting has already started.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.300
Ah, oh no.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.180
Well, please don't get angry.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.590
You'll get wrinkles if you do.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.140
Sorry, sorry!

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.890
Now, let's get going.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.520
Everyone's waiting.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.020
In that case, Suzukaze-kun,

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.940
do your best.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.150
S-Sure...

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.900
The director doesn't seem very important.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.540
A company message?

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.280
m 0 0 l 0 42 l 69 42 l 69 0 l 0 0

Hey, newbie!

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.600
Oh, coming!

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.180
Have you worked with 3D before?

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.310
Um, I don't really know anything beyond drawing...

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.060
All right.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.230
That's fine.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:34.820
Well then, I want you to start by doing chapter one of this reference book.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.980
Okay!

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.990
Well, get to it.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.070
Huh?

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.740
That's all?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.790
What should I do?

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.790
I'm already lost.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.170

What are they doing?!

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.740
Is there... something you need help with?

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.080
Eh? Ah, yes.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.250
But I figured it out after thinking about it!

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.260

ask Hifumi questions through messages!

Sorry about earlier.
As for my question,
the reference book says you can hide all objects
other than the selected one,

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.850
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:59.350
As for my question, the reference book says
you can hide all objects other than the selected one,

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.190
but I can't find that toolbox.
Where is it?

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.360
but I can't find that toolbox.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.520
Where is it?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:03.860
You don't need to do that.
Just use the Ctrl+H hotkey

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.490
You don't need to do that.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.950
Just use the Ctrl+H hotkey.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:09.040
That has solved my problem.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.660
That has solved my problem. I'm grateful.
Thank you very much.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.330
I'm grateful. Thank you very much.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:13.410
No problem.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.540
No problem.  But you don't need to
use such stiff language! Smile! Smile!

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.920
But you don't need to use such stiff language! Smile! Smile!

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.290
Eh? But I'm a newbie...

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.750
Eh? But I'm a newbie...

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:21.970
It's okay! We're all pretty casual around here,
so it shouldn't be a problem. （ゝω・）

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.340
It's okay!

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.850
We're all pretty casual around here, so it shouldn't be a problem.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:26.920
Well, then... Thank you!

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.350
Well, then... Thank you !

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.420
...like that?

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:30.470
Well, then... Thank you !

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.510
Well, then... Thank you !

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:30.550
Well, then... Thank you !

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.590
Well, then... Thank you !

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:32.730

Yun, you're her senpai,
so shouldn't you invite Suzukaze-san to lunch?

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:30.280
Yun, you're her senpai, so shouldn't you invite Suzukaze-san to lunch?

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:32.950
I don't mind inviting her,
but why don't you do it?

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.790
I don't mind inviting her, but why don't you do it?

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.040
You do it, Yun!

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.540
You do it, Yun!

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.040
You're her senpai,
but you're such a coward!

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.290
You're her senpai, but you're such a coward!

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.300
Suzukaze-san, want to go have lunch?

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.060
Me, too! Me, too!

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.430
Um, what about Hifumi-senpai?

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.150
Oh, Hifumi-senpai never has lunch...

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.320
Want to come with us today?

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.030
S-Sorry...

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.830
Oh, sorry for causing you trouble.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.580
But...

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.120
I'd like to sometime!

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.370
Aoba... chan...

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.340
I-I'll go after all!

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.130
Aoba! Let's have lunch toge-

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.970
She's not here?

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.350
W-What's wrong?

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.430
Sorry for the late introduction.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.810
I'm Iizima Yun, from the character team.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.350
She joined at the same time I did.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.860
I'm Shinoda Hazime, from the animation team.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.320
Nice to meet'cha!

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:48.610
...you.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.070
I can't do it!

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.870
This is the first time I've had a kouhai!

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.370
And it's the first time we've met!

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.290
You don't need to worry about that.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.750
You're my senpai, after all!

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.710
Shinoda-senpai.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.920
Senpai?!

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.130
That kind of gives me goosebumps,

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.130
so just call me Hazime.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.960
Okay, then, Hazime-san.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.050
You can call me Aoba, too.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.430
Yeah, nice to meet you, Aoba... san.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.510
Wait, is that strange?

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:22.730
She kept bugging me on the company
message system to invite you to lunch!

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.960
Hey! Don't talk about that!

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.520
It's fine.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.610
You're nervous about having your first kouhai, aren't you?

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.740
You are too, though, Yun!

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.620
Hazime was interested in the conversation you had with Hifumi-senpai earlier, Aoba-chan.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.410
I told you not to talk about that!

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.920
Thank goodness.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.840
They all seem like nice people.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.140
All right, I'll keep working!

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.390
But before that, I'm heading to the bathroom.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.070
Toilet, toilet, going to the toilet, toile-

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.160
Y-Yagami-san!

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.870
W-What are you doing?

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.170
I went to the bathroom, but don't have an employee ID,

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.630
so the door wouldn't open!

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.420
Ah, yeah, the toilet is outside the office, after all.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.050
Aside from getting in and out of the office, if you don't have an employee ID,

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.590
you won't be able to punch in and punch out.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.390
It's rather irresponsible for management to have forgot that.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.430
Oh, Ko-chan.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.100
Did you take the picture for Aoba-chan's employee ID?

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.190
Huh?

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.900
I asked you to do that this morning, didn't I?

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.150
Oh.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.450
I'll go take it right now!

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.410
Stand by that wall.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.700
O-Okay!

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.710
Hey, while you're free to dress however you like here...

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.880
Why are you wearing a school uniform?

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.170
Oh, come on.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.220
It's not a school uniform; it's a suit.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.220
It's a fundamental part of being a business person.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.720
Doesn't look like one.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:24.230
Well, at least learn the proper way to wear a suit.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:26.480
Whoa

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:26.520
Whoa

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:26.570
Whoa

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:26.610
Whoa

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:26.650
Whoa

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:26.690
Whoa

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:26.730
Whoa

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:26.770
Whoa

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:26.820
Whoa

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:26.860
Whoa

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:26.900
Whoa

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:26.940
Whoa

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:26.980
Whoa

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:27.020
Whoa

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:27.070
Whoa

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:27.110
Whoa

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.150
Whoa

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.190
Whoa

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:27.230
Whoa

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.270
Whoa

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.310
Whoa

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:27.320
The suit doesn't go with her childlike face at all!

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:27.360
Whoa

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.400
Whoa

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:27.440
Whoa

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:27.480
Whoa

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:27.520
Whoa

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:27.570
Whoa

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:27.610
Whoa

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:27.650
Whoa

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.690
Whoa

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:27.770
Whoa

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.820
Whoa

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.860
Whoa

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.270
Well, whatever.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.070
I heard the voice inside your head just now!

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.820
Well, let's get this taken care of.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.330
There's not enough light.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.700
Hazime, lend me some lights.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:45.160
Huh?

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.540
I don't have any lights.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.500
Sure you do.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.330
That light-up sword.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.800
This is looking good!

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.010
Now then, just wait for it to be finished.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.090
I see.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.850
You couldn't get back in.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.770
Yeah. I had no idea what to do.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.020
I was about to cry.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.020
Sounds like it was rough.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.270
Why not have some snacks and relax a bit?

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.740
Amazing!

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:17.530
Hifumi-senpai,
would you like to have a snack?

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.160
Hifumi-senpai, would you like to have a snack?

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.870
I'd love to!
I brought some candy today! （`ω´　）

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.080
I'd love to!

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.490
I brought some candy today!

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.040
Here.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.090
Aoba-chan, you're studying 3D right now?

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.000
Yes.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.880
I want to learn it quickly so I can start working.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.840
When does the game you're making now go on sale?

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.180
When was it?

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.140
In half a year.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:48.680
Rumour has it that we're about to
enter the frighteningly busy period.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.890
-be able to-

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.770
We won't be able to... go home...

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.530
Saying it like that isn't helping!

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.240
But Yagami-san is already staying overnight, isn't she?

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.870
Is it because she's the leader?

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:08.000
It might be better to say she lives at the office.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.160
She's amazing.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.960
She does the workload of several people by herself.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.750
If only her personality weren't like that!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.760
Aoba, sorry for the wait.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.220
Here's your employee ID.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.180
It feels like I've really joined the company!

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.480
Well, you joined quite a while back...

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.440
It's important to take breaks,

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.020
but the work day isn't over yet, so hurry up and get back to work.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.980
Okay.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.780
So, how far have you progressed, Aoba?

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.780
Ah, well!

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.740
This far!

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.490
Oh, pretty fast.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.240
Once you get a bit further, I'll give you some work, so I'll be counting on you.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.830
You can learn the harder stuff through experience.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.750
Okay!

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.130
How's Aoba-chan doing?

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.590
She catches on pretty quickly, which is really nice.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.260
I've got high expectations for her.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.680
I'll do my best!

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.060
But-

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.390
Before that, I'm heading to the bathroom.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.240
To-ToToTo-Toilet-huh?

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.490
Yagami-san!

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.870
Good work, everyone.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.830
Yagami-san, you're not staying overnight tonight?

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.250
I won't last if I keep staying every night.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.920
And Rin will get mad at me.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.220
Rin-san gets mad?

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.430
She occasionally gets mad a lot.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.470

How was your first day?

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.520
Do you have any questions?

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.440
Y-Yeah!

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.690
Um...

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.610
There's an important thing I haven't asked.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.110
Sure, ask away.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.910
The new game our team is making-

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.950
What is it called?

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.580
No one told you?

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.170
Now that you mention it...

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.840
We never said it, either, huh?

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:29.720
The third instalment of Fairies Story.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.020
I...

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.940
...decided I wanted to be a character designer because of that game!

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.110
I'll do my best!

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.700
Thank you!

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.580
I'm so tired.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:07.590

Oh, it's Nenecchi.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.600
Aocchi!

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.770
Hey, did you hear?!

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.570
They're making a Moon Ranger movie!

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.770
Eh? What's that?

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:27.950
I've never heard of it.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.070
It's a popular anime!

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.580
It was worth being a fan for so long!

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.370
When it hits theatres, let's go together!

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.920
Sure, but I'm worn out now.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.710
I'm hanging up. Goodnight.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.000
Wait!

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.340
What?

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.800
I mean... I bet your first day at work was tough,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.260
so I didn't want to make you talk about work at home, too.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.390
No, it's fine.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.850
Hey, listen!

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.230
Something amazing happened!

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.610
You know Yagami Ko-san, right?

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.400
The person who did the character design for Fairies Story.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.530
I'm working with her now!

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.910
Eh?! That's amazing!

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.240
I'll do my best.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.620
Do my best so that I can do work, too.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.040
So we can make a new game.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:24.960
{}

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.840
Aocchi! Are game companies really busy?

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.090
I don't know yet, Nenecchi.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.960
But there was someone who stayed overnight at the office!

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.020
Maybe you encountered someone sleeping in nothing but their panties!

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.060
As if there's an adult who would do something like that!

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.040
Next time!
Next time
「This Is An Adult Drinking Party...」
